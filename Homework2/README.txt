1. How to Compile?
To compile homework 2 part A
g++ -g -std=c++11 -o hw2-A 2A.cpp

to compile homework2 part b
g++ -g -std=c++11 -o hw2-B 2B.cpp

2. Does it work?
2A and 2B does work.

list.h is the header file.
It contains classes for 2A and 2B, the difference in list-a and list-b is the functions inside class List.

list-a.cpp contains the functions from list-a.h.
list-b.cpp contains the functions from list-b.h

Questions
For Program A, what is the big-oh O() run-time of your append() method?
big-oh runtime is O(1)

For Program A, what is the big-oh O() run-time of your prepend() method?
big-oh runtime is O(1)

For Program A, if you were to use prepend() -- like we did in class -- what is the big-oh O() run-time of the cin << operator function?
big-oh runtime is O(1)

For Program A, if you were to use append() instead of prepend(), what is the big-oh O() run-time of the cin << operator function?
big-oh runtime is O(1)

Finally, for Program B, what is the space requirement (in big-oh O() notation) in for the loop reversal operation?
big-oh runtime is O(1)
