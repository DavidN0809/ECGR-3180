1. How to Compile
To compile homework 2 part A
g++ -o hw2-a 2A.cpp

to compile homework2 part b
g++ -o hw2-b 2B.cpp

2. Does it work
2A and 2B does work.

Questions
For Program A, what is the big-oh O() run-time of your append() method?
big-oh runtime is O(X)

For Program A, what is the big-oh O() run-time of your prepend() method?
big-oh runtime is O(X)

For Program A, if you were to use prepend() -- like we did in class -- what is the big-oh O() run-time of the cin << operator function?
big-oh runtime is O(X)

For Program A, if you were to use append() instead of prepend(), what is the big-oh O() run-time of the cin << operator function?
big-oh runtime is O(X)

Finally, for Program B, what is the space requirement (in big-oh O() notation) in for the loop reversal operation?
big-oh runtime is O(X)
